Hi everyone, I’m Art. From Manila Philippines

I'm grounded in IT Infrastructure, data centers, — all the heavy, technical side of IT operations. 
I started shifting August this year, I was hoooked and really amazed of what AI can do now.

I started exploring AI — first out of curiosity, then out of excitement, and eventually out of a deeper realization:
AI isn’t just a tool. It’s a new way of building, creating, and helping people.

That’s when I really fell in love with it.

I began learning , experimenting, asking questions, building small prototypes, and understanding how AI can merge with real-world operations.

I’m excited to be here, I’m still learning every day, and hackathon is a big time learning experience, I’m here to, learn, contribute, share ideas, and connect.

Let’s create something amazing together!
